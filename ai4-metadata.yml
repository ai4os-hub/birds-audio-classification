title: Bird sound classifier
summary: Classify audio files among bird species from the Xenocanto dataset.
description: '"**CAUTION: This module is in a development stage. Predictions might still not be reliable enough.** \n" "This is a plug-and-play tool to perform bird sound classification with Deep Learning." "The PREDICT method expects an audio file as input (or the url of a audio file) and will return a JSON with " "the top 5 predictions. Most audio file formats are supported (see [FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) compatible formats).\n" "We use the [Xenocanto dataset](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/b1047888-ae52-4179-9dd5-5448ea342a24) [1]" "which has around 350K samples covering 10K species. As an initial assessment we have trained the model on the" "73 most popular species, which account for roughly 20% of all observations.\n" "<img class=''fit'' width=550 src=''https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai4os-hub/birds-audio-classification/main/images/workflow-birds.png''/>\n" "This service is based in the [Audio Classification with Tensorflow](./deep-oc-audio-classification-tf.html) model.\n" "**References**\n" "[1]: Vellinga W (2019).
